Hello! This is my smartclient. I've included the # !/bin/env python so it should run normally on cmd.
eg: $python3 SmartClient.py (I made the mistake and used python instead of python3, took me about an hour before I noticed, haha)
When you wish to stop, just hit ctrl+c.

Please note, arguments don't do anything when you first enter the above line. But there is a reason for that.
I've designed it so the program can request multiple times instead of typing the same command over and over.
To get started, just run the command as above. You will then be prompt to input a domain name. Notes have been added
to each function on how they're suppose to work.

As the program runs, it will print out it's status such as, 'https accepted' as it goes through different cases.
When errors occur, such as not being able to connect to a website, the program will print out the said error.
The program also accepts anything after domain name such as, www.uvic.ca/undergraduate. However, to view the body please 
uncomment a line of code. Location is noted under 'Extra' at the bottom of this README.

Example cases:
When entering an alias such as: uvic.ca, the program will still attempt to find out http supports of the redirect.
When entering a full name such as: www.uvic.ca, the program will search for http supports.
When entering a non-vaild name such as: asdf, an error will show up and ask for another name.

Extra:
As stated in the outline, headers and responses were said to be optional. I did this with the intention
that who ever is marking doesn't have to scroll up a wall of body text. However, if you wish to see these then
uncomment line 155 (should be under the function 'cookie_farm' and the line is 'print(msg)) which will display the response.
