Things that have not been implemented yet: Part D, and time in part B
Please run the code with basic_structure.py in the same file since I imported functions from there.

Everything was tested on linux lab via ssh, should work fine when using the command:
%python3 PacketSniffer361.py {}.cap

Though I tested on the linux servers, the zip command there was giving me some troubles.

At first I approached the assignment by trying to build my own header reader (seen at the very bottom of the code, some were erased)
I noticed a little bit too late that we were given a TCP/Packet/IP header from basic struct and redid my code.

Once again, thank you for your hard work and I'll be sure to pay more attention to the resources given to me next time.
