## A little about myself
I like pie.

That aside, my first exposure to coding was when I got really lazy doing repetitive tasks and sought a way to make my life easier. That was my goal, but I ended up spending about 5 hours learning how to automate a task that took me a few seconds. How much time did I save? Not much, rather I saved negative time if we really want to argue. Ever since then, I just enjoyed solving problems and building stuff without the need to actually purchase myself say, a box of Lego. Nothing against Lego, I love it! But man... one set is almost 100$. Still worth it.
